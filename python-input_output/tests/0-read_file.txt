The ``0-read_file`` module
============================

Using ``read_file``
-------------------

First import ``read_file`` from the ``0-read_file`` module:

    >>> read_file = __import__('0-read_file').read_file

Now test it:

Test with regular file:
    >>> read_file("my_file_0.txt")

Test with empty file:
    >>> with open('empty_file.txt', 'w') as f:
    ...     pass
    >>> read_file("empty_file.txt")

Test with non-existent file (should raise FileNotFoundError):
    >>> read_file("nonexistent_file.txt")
    Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
    FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'nonexistent_file.txt'

Test with default parameter (empty string):
    >>> read_file()
    Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
    FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: ''
