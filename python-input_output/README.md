# Python - Input/Output

This project covers file handling and JSON operations in Python. It includes various tasks that demonstrate working with files, JSON serialization/deserialization, and class serialization.

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain:

* How to open a file
* How to write text in a file
* How to read the full content of a file
* How to read a file line by line
* How to move the cursor in a file
* How to make sure a file is closed after using it
* What is and how to use the `with` statement
* What is JSON
* What is serialization
* What is deserialization
* How to convert a Python data structure to a JSON string
* How to convert a JSON string to a Python data structure
* How to access command line parameters in a Python script

## Requirements

* All files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
* All files should end with a new line
* The first line of all files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
* Code should use the pycodestyle (version 2.7.*)
* All files must be executable
* All modules, classes and functions should have documentation

## Files

* `0-read_file.py`: Function that reads a text file and prints it to stdout
* `1-write_file.py`: Function that writes a string to a text file and returns the number of characters written
* `2-append_write.py`: Function that appends a string at the end of a text file
* `3-to_json_string.py`: Function that returns the JSON representation of an object
* `4-from_json_string.py`: Function that returns an object represented by a JSON string
* `5-save_to_json_file.py`: Function that writes an Object to a text file using JSON representation
* `6-load_from_json_file.py`: Function that creates an Object from a JSON file
* `7-add_item.py`: Script that adds all arguments to a Python list and saves them to a file
* `8-class_to_json.py`: Function that returns the dictionary description for JSON serialization of an object
* `9-student.py`: Class Student that defines a student
* `10-student.py`: Class Student with filtered attributes
* `11-student.py`: Class Student with JSON serialization/deserialization
* `12-pascal_triangle.py`: Function that returns Pascal's Triangle
* `100-append_after.py`: Function that inserts a line of text to a file after specific string
* `101-stats.py`: Script that reads stdin line by line and computes metrics
