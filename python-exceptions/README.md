# Python - Exceptions

## Description
This project focuses on understanding and implementing exception handling in Python. Through various tasks, we explore how to handle errors gracefully, use try/except blocks, and work with different types of exceptions.

## Resources
* [Errors and Exceptions](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html)
* [Learn to Program 11 Static & Exception Handling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vbgD-3s-w4) (starting at minute 7)

## Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

### General
* Why Python programming is awesome
* What's the difference between errors and exceptions
* What are exceptions and how to use them
* When do we need to use exceptions
* How to correctly handle an exception
* What's the purpose of catching exceptions
* How to raise a builtin exception
* When do we need to implement a clean-up action after an exception

## Requirements
### General
* Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
* All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
* All your files should end with a new line
* The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
* A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
* Your code should use the pycodestyle (version 2.7.*)
* All your files must be executable
* The length of your files will be tested using wc

## Files Description
* `0-safe_print_list.py`: Function that prints x elements of a list safely
* `1-safe_print_integer.py`: Function that prints an integer with "{:d}".format()
* `2-safe_print_list_integers.py`: Function that prints the first x integers of a list
* `3-safe_print_division.py`: Function that divides 2 integers and prints the result
* `4-list_division.py`: Function that divides element by element 2 lists
* `5-raise_exception.py`: Function that raises a type exception
* `6-raise_exception_msg.py`: Function that raises a name exception with a message
* `100-safe_print_integer_err.py`: Function that prints an integer with error message
* `101-safe_function.py`: Function that executes a function safely
* `102-magic_calculation.py`: Python function that does exactly the same as a given Python bytecode
