- References, assignments, and aliases
- Identifying when variables are identical or linked to the same object
- Displaying variable identifiers (memory addresses in CPython)
- Understanding Python's built-in mutable and immutable types
- How Python passes variables to functions

## Files
Answer files contain a single line with the appropriate response to questions about Python objects.
