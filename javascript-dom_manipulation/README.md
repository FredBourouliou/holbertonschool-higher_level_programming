# JavaScript DOM Manipulation

This project contains JavaScript scripts that demonstrate DOM manipulation techniques. Each script performs different operations such as:

- Changing element colors and text
- Adding/removing classes
- Adding and removing elements from lists
- Fetching data from APIs and updating page content
- Event handling

These scripts are examples of common JavaScript DOM manipulation tasks performed without any external libraries or frameworks.
